# PDAShell
A PDA-like operating environment for Microsoft Windows

## Context

In a world with too many distractions, notifications, and addictive services; there is a place where you become calmer and actually get things done.

That is the purpose of **PDAShell**, to provide a classic, yet productive, UI where you become **more productive**.

PDAShell is still in development, so not all features are present.

## Building

To build this program you need to perform the following steps:

Requirements: [**.NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-developer-pack-offline-installer)

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2017 or later (make sure the .NET Development workload is installed. If not, use the Visual Studio Installer to add it to your installation)
3. Go to Build -> Build Solution, or press CTRL-SHIFT-B

You've now grabbed a copy of PDAShell straight from the source!

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this program:

1. Create your own branch or fork, **based on the weekly branch**
2. Work on your changes **and test them!!!**
3. Commit such changes
4. After you're done, create a pull request

Not a lot is implemented, so this is crucial.
